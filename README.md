# Webscraping-Fun
Messing around with various small projects to learn more about web scraping.

So far there is:

A Bad Joke Generator, using BeautifulSoup to scrape a website for bad jokes and selecting one at random to output.

A Reddit API Wordcloud script that allows you to input a subreddit and the category(Top, Rising, etc.) and generates a wordcloud from the titles gotten from the selections, using the Reddit API.

A Twitter API Sentiment Analyzing script that allows you to input a keyword to search on and number of tweets (between 10 and 100) to use in the sentiment analysis, then prints the tweets with their respective polarities, the percentages of positive, negative and neutral tweets for the given keyword and displays a pie chart of those percentages. Uses Textblob, MatPlotLib, re, Clean-Text and Tweepy.
