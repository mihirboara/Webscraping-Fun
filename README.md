# Webscraping-Fun
Messing around with various small projects to learn more about web scraping.

So far there is:

A Bad Joke Generator, using BeautifulSoup to scrape a website for bad jokes and selecting one at random to output.

A Reddit API Wordcloud script that allows you to input a subreddit and the category(Top, Rising, etc.) and generates a wordcloud from the titles gotten from the selections, using the Reddit API.
